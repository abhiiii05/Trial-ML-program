# HOUSE PRICE PREDICTOR (A-Trial-ML-program)
A very basic program to understand the basics of Machine Learning . 
<p>A very basic machine learning model to predict the price of houses at different locations. This project utilizes the Boston Housing Dataset from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, RandomForestRegressor.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly model that can predict the housing prices for new houses in different locations. The Boston Housing Dataset has been widely used in many machine learning papers and it's an excellent resource for those who are new to the field.</p>

<p>Please note that this model is just a starting point and does not take into account additional factors such as commuting time, public transportation availability, nearby parks, crime rates, and more. To get more accurate predictions, additional features should be incorporated.</p>
